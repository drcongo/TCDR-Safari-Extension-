# TC;DR

A Safari extension to let site owners know that you closed the tab and didn't read their article because of their bullshit modal overlays. See [Tab Closed; Didn't Read](http://tabcloseddidntread.com) for more details.

## How

Simply scans the page for the site owner / author's Twitter username and then opens a pre-filled Tweet compose screen. User is free to add their own vitriol.

## To do

* More scanning methods.
* Messaging when it fails to find a Twitter username.

### Contributing

Feel free.
